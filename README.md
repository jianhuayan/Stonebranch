# Stonebranch
technical assesment implementation notes
    Jeff Yan
    
    (1) Code is written Python3 complaint.
    (2) Run customer_qa.py, invoice_qa.py,invoice_item_qa.py in sequence will ensure generating anticipated results.
    (3) Input files needs to be clean (utf-8 encoded) as specified in requirement document.
    (4) Testing is done using small datasets.
    (5) The implementation could be done much easiier using database technologies but author chosed not to using database in stead
        using hashing machanism and hope that is Stonebranch wants
    (6) Some test code can be written using python test module but run out of time.
